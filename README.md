# Applicant Tracker :
This Python script reads applicant data from a CSV file and filters the applicants based on required technical skills. It then conducts a simulated technical round and soft skill round for the qualified applicants, calculating scores for each. The combined scores are calculated using weighted averages, and the script selects the best candidate based on these scores. The script is designed to assist in automating the applicant evaluation and hiring process, providing an efficient and objective way to identify the most suitable candidate for a given position.
